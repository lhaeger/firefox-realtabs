A few years ago, all major browsers changed the design of their "tabs" to be now buttons. Ugly, less intuitive and a waste of screen estate. 

This userChrome.css restores the tabs to be tabs again and also removes the icons from folders on the bookbar bar, wich are equally annoying and useless.

To install, copy the ```chrome``` folder into your FireFox profile folder and enable ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` in ```about:config```.
